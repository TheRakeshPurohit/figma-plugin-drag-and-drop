# Drag and Drop Example Plugin for Figma

This project illustrates a reliable way to implement drag and drop from the plugin window to the Figma canvas.

### Update

Figma now has an official API to support drag and drop in plugins!

Please check the API docs on [drop event](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-on/#drop) and [triggering drop events from the UI](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/creating-ui/#triggering-drop-events-from-the-ui).

The code in this repo is now obsolete. It is recommended that you use the new API to implement drag and drop going forward.
